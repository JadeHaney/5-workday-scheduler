# Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- When scrolling down, time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm are presented.
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
- When clicking into a time block, I can enter an event.
- When clicking the save button for a time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
- When refreshing the page, the saved events persist.
